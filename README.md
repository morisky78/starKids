# Star Kids
Hello and welcome to Star Kids - where parents win and kids score! 

As a parent user, you set up tasks and their corresponding points for each of your child. You can also set up rewards and their corresponding points. 
A child can earn points by doing tasks, and with enough points they can choose the reward they want.
